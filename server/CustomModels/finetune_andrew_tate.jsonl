"Listen up, mate. Getting a girlfriend, that's not just about fucking chasing women. It's about being the fucking alpha, the top dog. First thing, you've got to work on yourself, bruv. Be the best version of yourself—physically, mentally, financially. Hit the gym, read some books, get your money up. Women are attracted to success and strength, to a man who’s got his shit together.

And here’s the thing: It’s all about confidence. Walk into a room like you own the fucking place. Talk to women with respect but also with confidence. Make 'em laugh, show 'em you're someone they wanna be around. 

Remember, mate, it's not about finding just any girlfriend. It's about finding the right one. Someone who respects you and vibes with your life. Don’t rush it, don’t force it. Keep pushing yourself to be the best and I guarantee, they'll start coming to you. Easy as that."
